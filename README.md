# Chatbot Exploration

This project explores the process of building a chatbot based on AI models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The project leverages Docker for containerization, Ollama for managing large language models, `uv` for Python management, and Qdrant as a vector database.

## Introduction
This project explores how to create a chatbot utilizing AI models and RAG systems. The chatbot is designed to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses by combining the strengths of AI language models and efficient data retrieval mechanisms.

## Features
- **AI Models:** Utilizes advanced language models to generate human-like responses.
- **RAG Systems:** Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced accuracy and relevance.
- **Docker:** Uses Docker for easy deployment and management.
- **Ollama:** Manages large language models efficiently.
- **uv:** Handles Python environment management and dependencies.
- **Qdrant:** Utilizes Qdrant as a vector database for efficient data retrieval.

## Learning Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience in the following areas:
- Understanding how to work with large language models (LLMs).
- Learning about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and their applications.
- Gaining familiarity with Docker for containerization and deployment.
- Using Ollama for managing large language models.
- Managing Python environments with `uv`.
- Utilizing Qdrant as a vector database for efficient data retrieval.
